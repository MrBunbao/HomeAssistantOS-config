## About

Hello! I'm Andy. Just a dude who has embarked on a journey of learning Home Automation (networking as well). This is my personal project that started my homelab in 2022. 

Please, there isn't much - but enjoy looking around and hopefully I inspired a line or 2 of code for you.

## Home Assistant - Bao Butler is what we like to call it at home

*work in progress*

My home is using Home Assistant as the backend system while HomeKit is our frontend. I chose this route because of a few things: I love Apple products and am slightly ashamed how deep in the ecosystem I am. My beautiful girlfriend, Shannon, also has a iPhone. Bazinga, we go with HomeKit with everything laid out to help her ease into the life of home automation. This is very important. You must get the partner approval.
